                                  <b> Seeker of Sand</b> is a game project realise me and my collective during 6 months. Seeker of Sand is mix between a Vampire Survivor like and a hack'n slash. The player embody the champion of the desert and use it knowledge from alchemy to erease the corruption from the desert. For the demo, the goal is to survive during 3 nights in the desert. For fighting monsters, players will need to choose spell to fight and the order in which they will be launch to create fun combos.

                              We realise this project on the game engine Unity 2021. We wanted to a precise and more realistic lighting in our game so we decide to use the HDR Renderer Pipeline to have this result. This project has multiple technical challenges to face. We wanted to have large level to recreate a desert sensation and we need have lots of enemies to show the power of the avatar.

                               On this project, I have multiple roles the first one is to be the  <b>technical director</b> of the project. My job is to produce code for the game and I'm need to assure that the game is working correctly on this technical aspect. The second job I have to work on the<b> game design</b> of the project and help the other game designer to create, balance and test our game.

                                    As I said earlier I'm responsible for all game systems. I want to talk about some systems that I think was interresting to make. The first one is the player mouvement system that own few state like run, slide, glide, dash and be knockback. Our first intention with the player mouvement system was to create already fun to use and with a lot of possibility. We wanted to have a system that behave organically and a emergence with other mecanics of game like explosion for exemple. So the challenge was to create a system that is flexible to work in any situation and also leave some place to be able to have good amount of control on it.
