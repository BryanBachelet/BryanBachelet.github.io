                                    Lich Engine is a game engine project that my team and I realised during ours second year of studying of game programming. The goal of this project was to create a funcitonnal engine from scratch with base features like have sound or manage animations. Ours intention with this project was to create a game engine that is design to create horror game. For this project, we were 4 peoples to work on it during 3 months:
                                    <ul>
                                        <li>Lenny Rabinne</li>
                                        <li>Mathe Erbisti </li>
                                        <li>Antoine Mordant</li>
                                        <li>Bryan Bachelet</li>
                                    </ul>
                                </div>
                                <div class="part two">
                                   <img src="LichEngineImg.png">
                                </div>
                        </div>
                        <div class="section beta ">
                            <div class="part one">
                                We have also implemented plenty of others features to have complete and functionnal engine. Let's make a list none exhaustif :
                                <ul>
                                    <li>Physics</li>
                                    <li>Editor Interface</li>
                                    <li>Animations</li>
                                    <li>Sounds</li>
                                    <li>UI</li>
                                    <li>SkyBox</li>
                                    <li>Resources Manager</li>
                                </ul>
                            </div>
                            <div class="part two">
                                The main focus of our engine was the graphics quality to have the best immersion, something that is realy important for horror game. So this engine implements multiples graphics effects like :
                                <ul>
                                    <li>PBR</li>
                                    <li>Shadow for every type of light</li>
                                    <li>Deferred Rendering</li>
                                    <li>SSAO</li>
                                    <li>HDR</li>
                                </ul>
                             </div>
                             </div>
                            <div class="section gamma ">
                                <div class="part one">
                                    <img src="LichEngineImg.png">
                                </div>
                                <div class="part two">
                                    On this project, I work on multiple systems. The main one is the engine <b>Editor UI</b> which I implemented scene hierachy window, file broswer or inspector window for example.For this system, I implemented reflexion in order to facilitate the Editor creation. The second system on which I work was the <b> Scene system of the engine</b>. I made the scene manager system, and the save system of them.
